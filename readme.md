# iDEP and ShinyGO webserver
## Let the data speak for itself!
Interactive tools for analyzing genomics data.  

This repository now only hosts code for our webserver and some legacy scripts. Please visit repositories for [iDEP](https://github.com/gexijin/idepGolem) and [ShinyGO](https://github.com/gexijin/shinygo), which are linked as submodules. 

[iDEP](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/) is a Shiny app for analyzing RNA-seq or other transcriptomic data. See [documentation](https://idepsite.wordpress.com/) and [paper](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2486-6).  iDEP's younger, but more popular, sister, [ShinyGO](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/) focuses on the enrichment analysis of gene lists. The same database is used. ShinyGO is published [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz931). 

## No Warranty
iDEP and ShinyGO are both under active development, and have not been fully tested. With the help of many users, we are constantly fixing bugs/errors in both source code and sometimes database. We recommend that you confirm your findings using other tools before publishing or further studies.
