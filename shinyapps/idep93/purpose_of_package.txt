This file explains the purpose for each package that is used, I figured this would be a useful file once multiple packages are used.

Start data: 06-06-2022 (mm-dd-yyyy)
Data last modified: 06-06-2021, 12:46 PM CST (mm-dd-yyyy,TIME) to help with github merge

Note: I will use package::function either when it's needed, or making it easier to tell where some functions come from.
